# INOV-Inc.
INOV is a technology-based financial services Company. 

  My name is David Okoronkwo. I am a Finance Major and Economics Minor at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Connecticut.
Over the past year, Three of my friends and I began working on INOV. We believe it could advance retial, institutional and credit banking whilst improving access to capital both domestically and globally. 
The Company allows people to open and manage a checking and savings account. Each account will hold a debit card that shows the depositors name. 

In Addition to that, We have developed what we call a DCL (Digital credit lines). this is a generated Cryptography id linked to each depositors name and linked to  the back end of each depositor account. this would help the developemnt of our Virtual Credit Card Processings and the societal push to a cashless society. 

Virtual Credit Cards would allows us along with other financial institutions automate credit score calculations and administer more fair and feasible loans to clients to pay off more serious payments such as mortgage, short and long term loan payments/debts. We compute an average that is placed on a form of measurement which determines each individual depositor's credit score and properly assigns each individual a loan we feel they can pay off more with no issue. 

On a global front, INOV has developed features that would allow for clients and avid travelers accross the world simpler to access financial services outside thier borders. A feature we developed allows clients access differents currencies and convert their cash accounts to the chosen currency of their choice in real time and at low cost removing the excess trouble of attaining currencies upon international travel. 
In our push for more financial backing to SME grwoth and scale, For more rural areas around the world. We plan on leveraging the SMS/text message to enable more access to capital for domestic and global SME growth and increased technological application in less developed countries.
