# INOV-Inc.
INOV is a technology-based financial services Company I began developing in march of 2021. 

  My name is David Okoronkwo. I am a Finance Major and Economics Minor at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Connecticut.
Over the past year, a few of my friends and I have been working on this Technology-based Financial services project/company that we believe could advance retial, institutional and credit banking systems whilst improving access to capital both domestically and globally. 
The Company allows people to open and manage a checking and savings account. Each account would be secured with a debit card that shows the depositors name. 

A reason for the card being desingned like this is due to a coined term i developed called DCL (Digital credit lines). this is a hash value id developed by copmputing the numerical value of each depositors name and linking this pin to the back end of each depositor account. this would also allow to quickly change and adapt as we move closer into a cashless and credit-card less society. 

We would automate the way people build credit and pay off more serious payments such as mortgage, short and long term loan payments. We compute a form of measurement which determines each individual depositor's credit score and properly assigns each individual a loan we feel they can pay off more with no issue. 

As I hope to build this On a global spectrum, INOV has a feature that would allow ease for consumers and travelers accross the world will need to access different forms of currency and convert their cash accounts to the currency of their choice in real time and pay at a low cost removing the excess trouble of attaining currencies upon international activities. 
For more rural areas around the world. We plan on leveraging the SMS/text message to enable more access to capital for global small business growth. 

We are Currently have an Executive Team

David Okoronkwo - co-CEO, Head of Strategy, Interim CTO
