INTRO 

We have developed a program which we call the DCCS. It is the Digital Credit Code System which we believe will improve the services of the already in place credit/debit card. We use the existing technology of Cryptography which uses generated computer codes for safe encryption of data and other valuable software.


DCCS

The DCCS would allow Financial institutions to more accurately calculate credit score, administer more fair and feasible loans to clients to pay off more serious payments such as mortgages, short and long term loan payments/debts. The DCCS takes away more Administrative/Logistical issues Financial institutions take into account when delivering credit scores to clients such as closure of older accounts and maxing out of cards. 


VIRTUAL CREDIT/DEBIT CARD PROCESSING

Virtual Credit/Debit card infrastructure could pose to be the next frontier for Fin-tech and the Whole Finance Sector. The Scale at which it could provide proper financial services across the globe is something I believe should be looked deeply into for R&D and Investment from the Private and Public sector. Through the enablement of high end technology such as AI (Artificial Intelligence) and much improved GUI (Graphical User Interfaces) we can properly build Digitized Infrastructures that can be scaled Globally at low cost.
 

DOMESTIC & INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS

Financial transactions happen every minute and occur on a day to day basis. Building applicable tools that allow more direct access to capital on both domestic and international would prove vital for economic development. 

FORMAL CRYPTO BANKING

Although Crypto has mixed reactions from the public, Many are still bullish on its value and what it can do long term. our software includes funcitonality to handle crypto accounts with a design in mind of what we think it could be. 

CHECKING & SAVING ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

Our software allows functionalities for autonomous management of depositor accounts.
