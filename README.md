# INOV-Inc.
INOV is a technology-based financial services Company. 

  My name is David Okoronkwo. I am a Finance Major and Economics Minor at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Connecticut.
Over the past year, Three of my friends and I began working on INOV. We believe it could advance retial, institutional and credit banking whilst improving access to capital both domestically and globally.

DESCRIPTION 
We created a product which we call the DCCS. It is the Digital Credit Code System which performs the services of the already in place credit/debit card. 
The Company uses the existing technology of Cryptography which uses generated computer code for safe encryption of data and other valuable software. 

Virtual Credit Cards would allows us along with other financial institutions automate credit score calculations and administer more fair and feasible loans to clients to pay off more serious payments such as mortgage, short and long term loan payments/debts. We compute an average that is placed on a form of measurement which determines each individual depositor's credit score and properly assigns each individual a loan we feel they can pay off more with no issue.

APPLICABLE BUILD
Each generated code will be linked to the account of every individual depositor. 
We will then shorten the code to five digits which will serve as a Virtual Credit Card and would be used for the purchase of goods and services.  

SECURITIZATION 
If/when an account is breached, the depositor should notify us by pressing the 
‘Get new Pin’ button. This would take the depositor to a new page in which we would ask them to login by putting in the full original generated ID that’s not shorted. Upon that failure, we will then give them a temporary pin password in which they can log back into their account and receive a newly generated ID that will be put back into the linkage of the the account. 


On a global front, INOV has developed features that would allow for clients and avid travelers accross the world simpler to access financial services outside thier borders. A feature we developed allows clients access differents currencies and convert their cash accounts to the chosen currency of their choice in real time and at low cost removing the excess trouble of attaining currencies upon international travel. 
In our push for more financial backing to SME grwoth and scale, For more rural areas around the world. We plan on leveraging the SMS/text message to enable more access to capital for domestic and global SME growth and increased technological application in less developed countries.
